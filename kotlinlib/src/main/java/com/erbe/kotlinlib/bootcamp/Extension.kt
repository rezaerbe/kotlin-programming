/*
add(element: E)
Add an item to the mutable list.

remove(element: E)
Remove an item from a mutable list.

reversed()
Return a copy of the list with the elements in reverse order.

contains(element: E)
Return true if the list contains the item.

subList(fromIndex: Int, toIndex: Int)
Return part of the list, from the first index up to but not including the second index.
*/

/*
The value for const val is determined at compile time,
where as the value for val is determined during program execution,
which means, val can be assigned by a function at run time.
That means val can be assigned a value from a function, but const val cannot.
*/

/*
It's very common to write utility functions to extend the behavior of a class.
Kotlin provides a convenient syntax for declaring these utility functions: extension functions.
Extension functions allow you to add functions to an existing class without having to access its source code.
*/

/*
Pairs and triples can be used to return more than one value from a function. For example: val twoLists = fish.partition { isFreshWater(it) }
Kotlin has many useful functions for List, such as reversed(), contains(), and subList().
A HashMap can be used to map keys to values. For example: val cures = hashMapOf("white spots" to "Ich", "red sores" to "hole disease")
Declare compile-time constants using the const keyword. You can put them at the top level, organize them in a singleton object, or put them in a companion object.
A companion object is a singleton object within a class definition, defined with the companion keyword.
Extension functions and properties can add functionality to a class. For example: fun String.hasSpaces() = find { it == ' ' } != null
A nullable receiver allows you to create extensions on a class which can be null. The ?. operator can be paired with apply to check for null before executing code. For example: this?.apply { println("removing $this") }
