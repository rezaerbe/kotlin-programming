# Kotlin Programming

Kotlin programming are collections of kotlin course from multiple official source.

## [**Learn Kotlin by Example**](https://play.kotlinlang.org/byExample/overview)

While reading [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/basic-syntax.html) is easy and pleasant, learning everything by example is a different kind of fun. This is an official set of small and simple annotated examples designed for those new to Kotlin. No prior knowledge of any programming language is required.

You can run each snippet of code, check the result, and then run it again. Learn and play!

## [**Kotlin Koans**](https://play.kotlinlang.org/koans/overview)

Kotlin Koans is a series of exercises to get you familiar with the Kotlin syntax and some idioms. Each exercise is created as a failing unit test, and your job is to make it pass. Here you can play with Koans online, but the same version of exercises is also available via JetBrains educational plugin right [inside IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio.](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/education/learner-start-guide.html?section=Kotlin Koans)

## [Kotlin Quick Guide for Android Basics in Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/kotlin-quick-guide)

This Kotlin Quick Guide summarizes the topics covered in the [Android Basics in Kotlin course](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course) in the form of code snippets.

## [Kotlin Bootcamp for programmers](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/kotlin-bootcamp-welcome)

### **Lesson 1: Get started**

In lesson 1, you install the necessary tools to work with the Kotlin REPL (read-evaluate-print loop) interactive shell and IntelliJ IDEA, and you practice using the basic syntax of Kotlin code.

Start the lesson:

- [Kotlin bootcamp for programmers 1: Get started](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/kotlin-bootcamp-introduction/)

### Lesson 2: Kotlin basics

In lesson 2, you learn how to work with Kotlin data types, operators, variables, booleans, and conditions. You explore the difference between nullable and non-nullable variables, and you practice using Kotlin arrays, lists, and loops.

Start the lesson:

- [Kotlin bootcamp for programmers 2: Kotlin basics](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/kotlin-bootcamp-basics/)

### **Lesson 3: Functions**

In lesson 3, you learn how to create a program with a `main()` function and arguments in IntelliJ IDEA. You create small programs as you learn about default values, compact functions, list filters, basic lambdas, and higher-order functions.

Start the lesson:

- [Kotlin bootcamp for programmers 3: Functions](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/kotlin-bootcamp-functions/)

### Lesson 4: Classes and objects

In lesson 4, you learn about classes, objects, and inheritance in Kotlin. You create small programs as you learn about abstract classes, interfaces, and interface delegation. You implement an abstract class, an interface implemented in subclasses, and by using interface delegation.

Start the lesson:

- [Kotlin bootcamp for programmers 4: Object-oriented programming](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/kotlin-bootcamp-classes/)

### Lesson 5.1: **Extensions**

In lesson 5.1, you learn about collections, constants, and extension functions in Kotlin. You create small programs as you learn about pairs, triples, lists, and hash maps for storing data, and you implement extension functions to add functionality to existing classes.

Start the lesson:

- [Kotlin bootcamp for programmers 5.1: Extensions](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/kotlin-bootcamp-extensions/)

### Lesson 5.2: **Generics**

In lesson 5.2, you learn about generic classes, methods, and functions in Kotlin. You create a type hierarchy and make the classes more flexible by making them generic, and you extend their functionality with generic methods and functions.

Start the lesson:

- [Kotlin bootcamp for programmers 5.2: Generics](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/kotlin-bootcamp-generics/)

### Lesson 6: **Functional manipulation**

In lesson 6, you learn about annotations, labeled breaks, and single abstract method (SAM) interfaces, and you review lambdas and higher-order functions. You create and use lambdas and higher-order functions, and learn about some useful higher-order functions in the Kotlin Standard Library.

Start the lesson:

- [Kotlin bootcamp for programmers 6: Functional manipulation](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/kotlin-bootcamp-sams/)

## [Android Basics in Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course)

Welcome to Android Basics in Kotlin! In this course, you'll learn the basics of building Android apps with the Kotlin programming language. Along the way, you'll develop a collection of apps to start your journey as an Android developer.
